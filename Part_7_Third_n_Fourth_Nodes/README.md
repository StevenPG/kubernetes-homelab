# Third and Fourth nodes!

Good news! Setting up the 3rd and 4th nodes just requires following step 4 and 6 again. However, our 4th node is going to ONLY be a worker and node a control plane node. This will give us a 4 node cluster with 3 master/worker pairs and a quorum of 3 nodes.

For the sake of brevity, I won't be rehasing the steps here, but will present the results!
