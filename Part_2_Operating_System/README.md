# Installation

The installation of operating systems on hardware is just as tedious as I remember it being during college working as a help desk support tech.

But it's just a little bit worse now that I have one shared monitor and keyboard, and four individual desktop machines, all with different graphics hardware.

But it must be done, so here we go.

## Complicated Steps 1-24

For each box, look at the graphics output on the machine.

In my situation, there's anywhere from VGA, DVI-ABC123 or HDMI on the backs of these boxes.

I grabbed a cable for each of those, an old crappy monitor (that only has VGA and DVI-D ports), and plugged them in one at a time until I have a free-hanging cable out of the back of each machine.

With that, I plugged in my trusty USB drive with an installable Ubuntu ISO deployed and ran through the default installation on each node.
